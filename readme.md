## by Khaled

## Dataset

>Ford GoBike System Data is a set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
Bay area.this dataset required some data wrangling in order to make it tidy berfore stepping forward to the exploatory part.There was two main parts to works on in this project. The first that included the data wrangling and the exploratory analysis, and the other was taking the main findings from exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, a slide deck is needed to  polish leverages, and explanatory visualizations to communicate the results

## Summary of Findings

>During my exploration of the dataset I found that :
1- Saturday and sunday were had the least numbers of trips.
2- The number of the male riders is more than than females, most members were subscribers and the majority of the members did not use bike share for all of their trips.
3- Most rides were between 5 to 10 minutes.
4- The customers tend to spend more time in their trip than the subscribers.
5- Subscribers makes more trips over all the week days than the customers.
6- The number of males is higher than females over all the week days.
7- More subscribers at the age between 40 and 60 tend to spend more time than the customers at the same age.
8- The average trip duration for the customers takes more time than the subscriber ride over all the week days.

## Key Insights for Presentation

>For this part of the project i will choose these two threads to polish up for the presentation :
1- Most rides were between 5 to 10 minutes.
2- Difference between average trip duration for customers and subscribers
